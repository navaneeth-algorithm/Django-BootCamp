                    French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980), the best known 
                    European public intellectual of the twentieth century, 
                    developed a highly original political philosophy, 
                    influenced in part by the work of Hegel and Marx. 
                    Although he wrote little on ethics or politics prior 
                    to World War II, political themes dominated his writings 
                    from 1945 onwards. Sartre co-founded the journal Les Temps 
                    Modernes, which would publish many seminal essays on political 
                    theory and world affairs. The most famous example is Sartre’s 
                    Anti-Semite and Jew, a blistering criticism of French complicity 
                    in the Holocaust which also put forth the general thesis that oppression 
                    is a distortion of interpersonal recognition. In the 1950’s Sartre moved

                    towards Marxism and eventually released Critique of Dialectical Reason, 
                    Vol. 1 (1960), a massive, systematic account of history and group struggle. 
                    In addition to presenting a new critical theory of society based on a 
                    synthesis of psychology and sociology, Critique qualified Sartre’s earlier, 
                    more radical view of existential freedom. His last systematic work, 
                    The Family Idiot (1971), would express his final and most nuanced views 
                    on the relation between individuals and social wholes. Sartre’s pioneering 
                    combination of Existentialism and Marxism yielded a political philosophy 
                    uniquely sensitive to the tension between individual freedom and the forces of 
                    history.
